                <p> We have the right to stop the offender from participating in the event if they refuse to comply with our rules or change their behavior. We require all participants to follow these guidelines at all times during the event. However, we also think that everyone should follow these rules outside the event as well.</p>

This event is for everyone, including you, to have a good time and be happy. You are most likely not the only one, so don’t feel as though it’s just you.
