            <h1>Goal of Event: Climate Change</h1>
            <p> Every year, our Hackathon helps celebrate creativity and innovation by making coding accessible to everyone throughout Wisconsin. We pride ourselves on hosting a diverse group of participants and encouraging divergent thinking to solve our world's toughest social issues. This year, in honor of Earth Day's 50th aniversary, we are focusing on the issue of Climate Change.</p>

                <h2> Why Climate Change?</h2>
                <p> Climate change is one of the biggest problems currently faced by society today. In addition to global temperature rise, climate change has led to droughts, flooding, heat waves, typhoons, wildfires, ocean acidification, and more. Melting ice caps and warming oceans are leading to substantial ocean rise, flooding cities and changing global weather patterns. Often these effects are hardest on the world’s most vulnerable populations; those who don’t have the option to simply move somewhere safer.</p>

                <h2>What can you do to help?</h2>
                <p> In this hackathon, participants will create technological innovations which will mitigate the effects of climate change. Groups will analyze ways in which technology helps and hinders the climate crisis and how it affects those already facing its effects.</p>
